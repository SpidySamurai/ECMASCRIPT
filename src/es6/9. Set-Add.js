const list = new Set();

list.add('item 1');
list.add('item 2').add('item 3');

console.log(list);

/* This code creates a new Set called list and adds elements to it using the add() method.

In the first line, an empty Set list is created using the new Set() syntax.

The next two lines use the add() method to add elements to the list Set.
The first add() call adds the string 'item 1' to the Set.
The second add() call adds the strings 'item 2' and 'item 3' to the Set. 
The second add() call is chained to the first one using dot notation.

Finally, the console.log(list) statement prints the list Set to the console.

In summary, this code demonstrates the usage of Sets in JavaScript. Sets allow storing unique values, and the add() method is used to add elements to the Set. In this example, three items are added to the list Set, and the Set is displayed in the console. */
