/* Defines a function called newUser that takes four parameters: user, age, country, and uID. The function creates and returns an object with properties user, age, country, and uID. The properties are assigned the corresponding values from the function parameters.

In the console.log statement:

The newUser function is called with arguments 'Spidy', 25, 'MX', and 1.
The returned object is logged to the console.
Essentially, this code is a function that creates a new user object with specific properties and their corresponding values. The console.log statement demonstrates how to use the newUser function by passing in specific arguments and displaying the resulting object in the console. */
