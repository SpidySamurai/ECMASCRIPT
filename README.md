![ECMAScript Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Node.js_logo.svg/200px-Node.js_logo.svg.png)

This repository contains examples of ECMAScript code from ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 13. 

## What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is the standard scripting language used to define the syntax and semantics of JavaScript. It provides a set of rules and guidelines that JavaScript implementations must follow to ensure compatibility across different platforms and environments.

ECMAScript is constantly evolving, with new versions released periodically to introduce new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Each new version brings additional functionality and improvements to the language, empowering developers to write more efficient and expressive code.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find examples of ECMAScript code organized by version. Each version's folder contains a set of code examples demonstrating the new features and syntax introduced in that particular version.

Feel free to explore the examples, learn from them, and use them as a reference for your own projects. You can also contribute by adding more examples or improving existing ones.

## Updates and Contributions

I will keep this repository up to date with each new ECMAScript version, adding examples and explanations for the latest features. Make sure to watch the repository to stay informed about updates.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional examples, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can create a valuable resource for the ECMAScript community.
